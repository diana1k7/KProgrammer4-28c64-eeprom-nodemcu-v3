I have included the schematics for various projects written in kicad, pcbway, and pcb artist. The schematics are provided under the apache 2.0 license, creative commons license with attribution required as well.

I believe in the creative process and creative community. Unfortunately. there are goats among the creative sheep which is why I insist on attribution and the two licenses mentioned above.

My belief is that one reaps what they sow.
So, I prefer to talk and share with creative people only.
Scwewd. Taking people. Don't talk to me.
