KProgrammer4 is an eeprom programmer that lets you write to 28c64 eeprom, 24c series eeprom (i.e. 24c256 - 4 pin io). Also, source bin file data is specifically via 24c eeprom to 28c64 eeprom, 28c64 eepom to 24c series eeprom, data file to either 28c64 eeprom or 24c series eeprom, terminal uoad data to either 28c64 or 24c series eeprom. Seven operating modes along with Switch register IO and terminal mode via arduino ide, putty, etc.
